    <div class="box"  MyBio">
  <p> Arabia is a media enthusiast from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, New York.
    She recieved her dual B.A degree in Computer Sciece and Studion Art from Smith College.
  </p>
  <p> As an artist and technologist, Arabiaâ€™s work often uses digital media
  to explore and highlight the narratives of black people. Her animations,
  digital paintings, short films, and video games challenge and reflect upon
  societal and political injustices. Oftentimes, analyzing the aftermath of
  cycles of police brutality, the school to prison pipeline, and poverty against
   black people.</p>
 <p>Arabia's long term goal is to start her own production company, focusing on
   telling stories of people of color. She wants her business to grow into her
   own TV network producing content ranging from TV shows(animated and real),
   movies, documentaries,  to video games, and comic books.
   Along with her company, she would like to create a nonprofit that bridges
   the gap between the arts and technology in low-income neighborhoods.
   Through community-based learning experiences such as workshops,
   internships, and creative technology-based community events she
   hopes to inspire the minority, Black and Latinx youth. </p>
