          <p>The Smith College Black Students’ Alliance (BSA) presents Vibranium Visions: Art and Tech Through the Black Eye,
            a conference centered on art and technology. February of 2018, we witnessed an incredible testament to
            Black artistic ability in Black Panther, a film featuring outstanding acting,
            breathtaking art direction, and stunning visual effects.
            What the characters in the film embody is the unsung talent that Black people possess,
             and the heights we can reach once that potential is unleashed.
            Although Wakanda is a fictional place, the message this film conveys
            rings true- there is tremendous talent in the Black community and
            infinite opportunities to apply that talent in the arts and technology.</p>
            <p>Since  1995, the BSA’s student-run biennial conference,
              consisting of thought-provoking discussions, workshops, and a keynote event,
              has been the best embodiment of these efforts. The conference has consistently drawn over 100 attendees,
              including Smith students, Smith alumnae, and undergraduate students from various colleges,
              such as Williams College, Wesleyan University, Amherst College, University of Massachusetts Amherst,
              and Mount Holyoke College. Our impact has extended beyond the Smith community, through our philanthropic
              contributions via donations to nonprofit organizations, and scholarship funds.
              Contributing to our appeal has been our ability to host influential keynote speakers,
              such as poet Nikki Giovanni, activist and academic Angela Davis,
              CEO/Founder of BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Beverly Bond, and musician India.Arie. </p>
            <p>The 12th biennial conference, will focus on the nexus between art and technology, while creating a
               pipeline for an underrepresented community in these fields. A primary
               goal distinguishing this year’s conference from the past is to elevate the
               networking aspect and to attract more students from colleges around the country.
               The addition of an Innovation Symposium, where amateurs and professionals will present
               their artwork and projects, contributes to our objective.</p>
