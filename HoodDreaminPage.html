          <p>"Hood Dreamin" is a rotoscope that moves back and forth between past
            memories and present-day. The rap and visuals together examine
            the result of racist institutional systems and their effects on
            people who are victims of the environment and cycle that these
            institutions have created. The ongoing project uses both audio and
            moving image to emphasize the use of gestures, color, time, and
            interruption of space to illustrate memory and cycles of oppression.</p>
          <p>The project delves into a world that is often pushed aside. The viewer
            is placed in the middle of the projects, pushed through the short video
            by an invisible force that serves as a parallel to the inescapable cycle
            of poverty. It is a documentation of survival. Arabia's work addresses the
          ‘make it out the hood’ mentality that surges through the minds of the youth
           in the projects she grew up in. The lyrics acts as an internal monologue,
           a conversation between her and her friends, a speech that she recites to her
           nieces. Arabia's piece is an expression of anger towards a system
           that consistently fails black inner city youth.</p>
           <p>‘Hood dreamin’ is a reflection of childhood in her neighborhood.
          This animation isn’t just an autobiography, but also a story of
          a generation of kids that grew up in the same hood, chasing the same
          dream, while trying to escape their self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
