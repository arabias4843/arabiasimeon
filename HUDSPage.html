            <p> One may argue that the internet has made us desensitized to violence. Many of us
              lay witness to violent crimes through social media and continue to share the viral video to
              raise awareness. While raising awareness we have become so numb to the amount of violence on the daily.
            </p>
            <p> I started college the a year after Eric Garner was killed by the hands of the police.
              College campuses all around the country were discussing police brutality and violence  against black people and
              how to combat these issues. Through my personal research I found that majority of white people I
              encountered were just oblivious to the oppression that black people face and have been facing for the past 400 years.

            </p>
            <p>"Hands Up Don't Shoot" is an interactive installation that challenges the
            viewer to face the topic of police brutality head on. In the room resides, a gun
            with the faces of police brutality victims collaged on it and a hidden speaker.
            The viewer is given one rule: "You must pull the trigger". At first this rule seems
            simple, because art is supposed to make contreversial topics easy to discuss. When the viewer
            pulls the trigger a viral police brutality audio clip is played.
