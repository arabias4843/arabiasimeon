          <p>This simulation was designed to model Jane Elliot's, "Blue eyes/Brown eyes" exercise
             Jane Elliot's eyes exercise seperates her students into two groups:
             Blue eyes and Brown eyes. The students who are assigned Blue eyes are treated
             as the superior group. The exerise teaches people about priviledge and racism through
             the act of putting the students in the minority's shoes.
          </p>
          <p> The Crack vs. Cocaine simulation splits the classroom in two: the oranges and pears.
            Both groups have been arrested for drug possession of either crack or cocaine. Both groups have
            similar criminal backgrounds and eduacation levels. The Teacher's Assistant was assigned the apple role which is
            the media. They recited the research and sample criminal reports for each imagined character. The professor acted as the judge
            and was assigned to give very harsh sentences to the pear group that was assigned crack.
           Congressâ€™s passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 created a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of
            five grams (or just a few rocks) of crack cocaine. This created a movement called the war on drugs that
            hit Black and Latinx inner-city poor communities by storm. The war on drugs resulted in the mass incarceration
            of Black and Brown people. Minorities were more likely to have access to crack.</p>
          <p>The simulation assigns the apple card to the white people in the class to force them to acknowlege
            their white priviledge. The black and brown people in the class were assigned to the pear
            group. After all participants have been sentenced they see that all of the pears have been
            sentenced to double the time for the same amount or less than the apples. This activity was created to challenge
            predominantly white institutions to discuss white priviledge and address the injustices that black and
            brown people face everyday. </p>
