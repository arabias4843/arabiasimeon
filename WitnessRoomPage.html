            <p>What does it mean to be queer and black? How do you have a vulnerable
              conversation in a space that doesn’t belong to you?</p>

            <p>Historically, bedrooms and living spaces have been seen as safe spaces for Black people.
              They’ve been a space for organizing, debate, and love. Similarly,
              for Queer folk it’s one of the few places one can be vulnerable, bedrooms are used to process,
              love and feel again. Witness Room is a constructed space that represents home in the black community.
              Within the community, the home was not only a place of organizing
              within the community but is also a place of vulnerability and comfortability.
              Nonetheless, being a queer black, masculine-presenting person, the idea of home or safe space
              isn’t always readily available. Often we have been pushed aside and underrepresented,
              the movement excludes our face and voice.
              Witness Room is a home where people like me have a voice that cannot be ignored.
              The viewer walks into a constructed “lived” space and interrupts it and the
              conversation between people they don’t know and can’t see.
              The work forces the viewer to take a step back and think about the space that they’re occupying. </p>
            <p>Through this audio-based project, I will be exploring the lines,
              boundaries, and intersections of what it means to be black, queer,
              and masculine-presenting this work acts as a therapy for me.
              It challenges the expectations and rules for making art.
              The work is a self-documenting and self-archiving practice
              that captures the rawness of conversation and expression surrounding gender, race, and sexuality.</p>
